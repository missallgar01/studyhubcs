Algorithms,Bubble Sort Efficiency,Bubble sort is slow on large lists because it may require many passes through the data.
Algorithms,Merge Sort,"A sorting algorithm that splits the list into smaller lists, sorts them, and then merges them back together."
Algorithms,Merge Sort Method,Uses a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sort data.
Algorithms,Merge Sort Efficiency,It is faster than bubble sort for large lists but uses more memory.
Algorithms,Algorithm Efficiency,A measure of how quickly an algorithm runs and how much memory it uses.
Algorithms,Time Complexity (GCSE),A way to compare how the running time of algorithms increases as the input size grows.
Algorithms,Memory Use,Some algorithms use more memory because they store extra copies of data.
Algorithms,Efficient Algorithm,An algorithm that completes its task quickly and uses minimal memory.
Boolean Logic,AND Gate,Outputs 1 only when all inputs are 1.
Boolean Logic,OR Gate,Outputs 1 when at least one input is 1.
Boolean Logic,NOT Gate,"Outputs the opposite value of the input (1 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 1)."
Boolean Logic,Truth Table,A table showing all possible input combinations and the resulting output for a logic gate.

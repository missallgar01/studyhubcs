    <b>Model full-marks answer:</b>
    <p>
      Algorithmic bias occurs when systems are trained using biased data, causing them to make
      unfair decisions. This can disadvantage certain groups, for example by rejecting job
      applications or loan requests unfairly. Because algorithms can lack transparency, affected
      individuals may not understand or challenge decisions, reinforcing existing inequalities.

  <div class="answer">
    <p><strong>a)</strong> Abstraction is removing unnecessary detail from a problem so that you
    can focus on the important parts that need solving. This reduces complexity and
    makes the problem easier to solve.</p>

    <p><strong>b)</strong> For example, the program could store the match result and the names of
    the try scorers, while ignoring details such as the time the try was scored,
    the player’s shirt number, or the venue.</p>

    <b>Model full-marks answer:</b>
    <p>
      A syntax error is a mistake in the rules of the programming language that prevents the
      program from running.
      A runtime error occurs while the program is running, for example when invalid data causes
      the program to crash.

    A group of students are working together on a single maze game.<br>
    The arrow keys control the character.
    When the character reaches the end of the maze without touching a wall, a happy sound is played.
    The game also displays a score.<br><br>
    Discuss the use of decomposition and abstraction in developing this game.<br>
    Your answer should include:<br>
    • a definition of each term<br>
    • the benefits each brings to the group of students<br>
    • an example of where each could appear in the program code.<br>

    <b>Model full-marks answer:</b>
    <p>
      Decomposition involves breaking the game into smaller parts such as movement, scoring and
      sound, allowing different students to work on each part.
      Abstraction removes unnecessary detail, for example by using functions to control movement
      without showing how the movement works internally.

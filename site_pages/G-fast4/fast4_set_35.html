Process: 	•	The microcontroller (1) in the mower would run a program (1). 	•	A map of the garden would be read (1) by the program so the mower would know where to go. 	•	The program would monitor (1) the power status to know if it needed recharging.  Output: 	•	The program on the mower could upload (1) statistics/information back to the application. 	•	The mower could have a digital readout / flashing lights (1) to indicate status.</div>

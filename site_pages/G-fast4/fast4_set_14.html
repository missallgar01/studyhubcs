            <p>When using a compiler to translate source code to machine code, the translation only needs to be done once.

Give three other features of a compiler.</p>
            <textarea class="input"></textarea>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> • Translates the entire source file to machine code in one go / translates all the source code prior to execution<br>• Shows all syntax errors at the end of the translation process<br>• Produces a single executable/object code/platform-dependent output<br>• Separates the tasks of translation and execution</div>

            <p>Computer worms are a type of malware.
Describe one way that a worm can move from machine to machine.</p>
            <textarea class="input"></textarea>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> • Worms make copies of themselves and send them to everyone in the computer’s email contacts list / send them via previous connections used by the computer<br>• Worms can spread (themselves) through emails and do not need a user to unknowingly distribute/execute them<br>• Worms self-replicate and spread without the need for a host file</div>

            <p>A code review is carried out by a programmer or an automated system and cost money. What is another  disadvantage of a code review by a programmer</p>
            <textarea class="input"></textarea>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Adds additional/significant time (to the development cycle) Introduces human error Requires an extra person/resource/labour Requires more experienced programmer</div>

            <h3>4. State/Identify</h3>
            <div class="marks">[4]</div>
            <p>The Internet of Things has allowed devices with embedded systems to function independently and to collect and exchange data without the need for humans.

One such device is a battery-powered mower for the garden.

(i)  Give one ways each category could be used by the mower.

            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> • Answer<br>One mark for each to a maximum of 4, with at least one in each category Connectivity:<br>• The mower could connect to a wireless/wired network<br>• The mower could have a GPS device . Input:<br>• A phone/desktop/software application could be used to schedule when it will work<br>• A map of the garden would be stored on the mower<br>• The mower would have sensors to know if it ran into things / if it was dark / if it were raining / if it ran outside the garden. Process:<br>• The microcontroller in the mower would run a program<br>• A map of the garden would be read by the program so the mower would know where to go<br>• The program would monitor the power status to know if it needed recharging. Output:<br>• The program on the mower could upload statistics/information back to the application<br>• The mower could have a digital readout / flashing lights to indicate status</div>

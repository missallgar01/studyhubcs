        <h2>Software Development – Notes</h2>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Software Development Life Cycles (SDLCs)</h3>
  <p>
    Software can be developed using a variety of approaches. The approach used
    depends on the type of software being developed but most software
    development life cycles (SDLCs) have some stages in common.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    Stakeholders state what they require from the finished product. This
    information is used to clearly define the problem and the system
    requirements.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Analysing strengths and weaknesses with the current way this problem is being solved</li>
    <li>Considering types of data involved including inputs, outputs, stored data and amount of data</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Design</h3>
  <p>
    The different aspects of the new system are designed, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inputs: volume, methods, frequency</li>
    <li>Outputs: volume, methods, frequency</li>
    <li>Security features: level required, access levels</li>
    <li>Hardware set-up: compatibility</li>
    <li>User interface: menus, accessibility, navigation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A test plan may also be designed at this stage.</p>

  <h3>Development</h3>
  <p>
    The design from the previous stage is used to split the project into
    individual, self-contained modules, which are allocated to teams for
    programming.
  </p>

  <h3>Testing</h3>
  <p>
    The program is tested against the test plan formed in the Design stage.
    There are various types of testing that can be carried out:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Alpha testing</strong><br>
      Alpha testing is carried out in-house by the software development teams
      within the company. Bugs are pinpointed and fixed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Beta testing</strong><br>
      Beta testing is carried out by end-users after alpha testing has been
      completed. Feedback from users is used to inform the next stage of
      development.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>White box testing</strong><br>
      Testing carried out by software development teams in which the test plan
      is based on the internal structure of the program. All possible routes
      through the program are tested.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Black box testing</strong><br>
      Testing where the software is tested without the testers being aware of
      the internal structure of the software. Can be carried out both within
      the company and by end-users. The test plan traces through inputs and
      outputs within the software.
    </li>
  </ul>



  <h3>Implementation</h3>
  <p>
    Once the testing stage has been used to make the appropriate changes to the
    software, it is installed onto the users’ systems.
  </p>



  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
  <p>
    After the implementation stage, the effectiveness of the software is
    evaluated against the system requirements defined at the analysis stage to
    evaluate its suitability in solving the problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Different criteria are considered, including robustness, reliability,
    portability and maintainability.
  </p>



  <h3>Maintenance</h3>
  <p>
    Any errors or improvements that could be made to the software are flagged
    up by the end-users. Programmers will regularly send out software updates
    to fix any bugs, security issues or make any needed improvements.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Waterfall lifecycle</h3>
  <p>
    The traditional waterfall model of software development is very well-known
    and well-defined but is now being replaced with more agile models.
  </p>
  <p>
    The waterfall model is based on a series of stages which are completed in
    sequence, from start to finish.
  </p>

<figure>

          <img src="images/softDev/waterfall.svg"  width="60%"/>

      </figure>

  <h3>Waterfall stages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Analysis</li>
    <li>Design</li>
    <li>Implementation</li>
    <li>Evaluation</li>
    <li>Maintenance</li>
  </ul>



  <h3>Feasibility study (TELOS)</h3>
  <p>
    The analysis stage includes a feasibility study in which designers evaluate
    the feasibility of the project using <strong>TELOS</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Technical:</strong>
      Is the project possible considering the technology available and accessible?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Economic:</strong>
      Can the project be financed in the short-term and the long-term?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legal:</strong>
      Can the project be solved within the law?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operational:</strong>
      Can the project be successfully implemented and maintained?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scheduling:</strong>
      Can the project be completed given the time available?
    </li>
  </ul>



  <h3>Limitations of the Waterfall model</h3>
  <p>
    If a change needs to be made within a project being developed using the
    waterfall model, programmers must revisit all levels between the current
    stage and the stage at which a change needs to be made.
  </p>
  <p>
    This makes the model inflexible and so unsuitable to projects with changing
    requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    This also means that users have little input as they are only involved at
    the very beginning and end of the waterfall lifecycle, during the analysis
    and evaluation stages.
  </p>
</div>

     <div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Agile methodologies</h3>
  <p>
    This refers to a collection of methodologies which aim to improve the
    flexibility of software development and adapt to changes in user
    requirements faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also easier to make improvements or changes to the software.
  </p>

<figure>

          <img src="images/softDev/agile.png"  width="60%"/>

      </figure>

  <h3>How Agile development works</h3>
  <p>
    The problem is broken down into sections which are developed in parallel.
    The design and analysis phase often occur together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Different sections of software can be at different stages of development.
  </p>



  <h3>Iterative development and prototyping</h3>
  <p>
    A working prototype is delivered early and prototypes are built upon and
    improved in an iterative manner so that new prototypes are delivered
    regularly throughout the course of the development cycle.
  </p>



  <h3>User involvement and feedback</h3>
  <p>
    User feedback is gathered regularly and used to refine prototypes and guide
    further development.
  </p>



  <h3>Documentation and user satisfaction</h3>
  <p>
    In agile development methodologies, there is less of a focus on documentation
    and more priority is given to user satisfaction.
  </p>
</div>

          <div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Extreme Programming (XP)</h3>
  <p>
    This is an agile model in which the development team consists of a pair of
    programmers alongside a representative end-user.
  </p>


  <h3>User stories</h3>
  <p>
    The model is built on <strong>user stories</strong>. System requirements are
    specified by the end-user and used when designing the program.
  </p>



  <h3>Paired programming</h3>
  <p>
    The aim of paired programming is to produce high-quality code, as the code
    is written by one person and critiqued by the other so it is improved as it
    is written.
  </p>
  <p>
    Programmers work no longer than <strong>forty hours a week</strong> with the
    aim that quality is not compromised.
  </p>



  <h3>Iterations and working versions</h3>
  <p>
    Each iteration through the cycle generates what is called a
    <strong>working version</strong> of the program, which means it could function
    as the final product.
  </p>



  <h3>Documentation and communication</h3>
  <p>
    The iterative nature of development means that it is hard to produce
    high-quality documentation, which is less of a priority.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order for XP to be effective, programmers must communicate effectively.
  </p>
</div>

 <div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Spiral model</h3>
  <p>
    The spiral model is built on four key stages with the focus of effectively
    managing risk-heavy projects:
  </p>

     <figure>

          <img src="images/softDev/spiral.svg"  width="60%"/>

      </figure>
  <ul>
    <li>Analysing system requirements</li>
    <li>Pinpointing and mitigating risks</li>
    <li>Development, testing and implementation</li>
    <li>Evaluating to inform the next iteration</li>
  </ul>



  <h3>Risk management and project suitability</h3>
  <p>
    If the project is found to be too risky at any point, the project is
    terminated.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, hiring risk assessors to analyse the risks involved can be
    expensive, which makes this methodology suited to only very large-scale
    projects.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Rapid application development (RAD)</h3>
  <p>
    RAD is an iterative methodology which uses partially functioning prototypes
    which are continually built upon.
  </p>
  <p>
    User requirements are initially gathered using focus groups and used to
    develop an incomplete version of the solution which is given to the user
    to trial.
  </p>



  <h3>User feedback and prototyping</h3>
  <p>
    User feedback is then used to generate the next, improved prototype and
    this continues until the prototype matches the requirements of the
    end-users, at which point it becomes the final product.
  </p>



  <h3>When RAD is used</h3>
  <p>
    This is commonly used where user requirements are incomplete or unclear
    at the start.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, as requirements change over the course of the project, additions
    and changes made to the code may be inefficient.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Writing and following algorithms</h3>
  <p>
    An algorithm is a set of instructions used to solve a problem. They are
    core to computer science and can be used to tackle a wide range of problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless of the problem, all good algorithms have certain key qualities:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inputs must be clearly defined – what is valid and what is invalid?</li>
    <li>Must always produce a valid output for any defined input</li>
    <li>Must be able to deal with invalid inputs</li>
    <li>Must always reach a stopping condition</li>
    <li>Must be well-documented for reference</li>
    <li>Must be well-commented so modifications can easily be made</li>
  </ul>

        <h3>Data Transmission and Error Detection</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>parity bit</strong> is an extra bit added to a group of data bits to help detect errors during transmission.
  It is a simple form of <strong>error detection</strong> used in digital communication systems.
</p>

<h4>How Parity Bits Work:</h4>

<p>
  <strong>Even Parity:</strong><br>
  The parity bit is set so that the total number of 1s in the byte (including the parity bit) is even.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Odd Parity:</strong><br>
  The parity bit is set so that the total number of 1s in the byte (including the parity bit) is odd.
</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Suppose we have a 7-bit data: <strong>1011001</strong></li>
  <li>
    Using even parity, we count the number of 1s (which is 4).
    Since it’s already even, the parity bit is <strong>0</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>The transmitted byte becomes: <strong>10110010</strong></li>
  <li>
    If an error occurs during transmission (e.g. a bit flips), the receiver counts the 1s and checks if the parity is still even.
    If not, an error is detected.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Limitations:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Parity bits can detect <strong>single-bit errors</strong> but cannot correct them.</li>
  <li>They fail to detect errors when <strong>two bits flip</strong> (even number of errors).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Parity checking is a simple but effective way to detect errors in data transmission systems like serial communication,
  RAM storage, and networking protocols.
</p>
        <p>When a message is transmitted, it is liable to corruption.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">


<h3>Checksum</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>checksum</strong> is an error-detection method used to ensure that data sent over a network or storage system
  is received correctly. It works by calculating a sum of all the bytes before transmission and sending this sum
  (checksum) along with the data. The receiver then performs the same calculation and checks if the result matches
  the sent checksum. If they match, the data is correct; if not, an error has occurred.
</p>

<h4>How Checksum Works with Sending Bytes</h4>

<h4>Step 1: Sender Computes the Checksum</h4>

<p>
  The sender takes all the data bytes and adds them together.
</p>

<p><strong>Given Bytes (8-bit each):</strong></p>

<p>
  01101101 (109 in decimal)<br>
  10000001 (129 in decimal)<br>
  10001000 (136 in decimal)
</p>

<p>
  109 + 129 + 136 = 374
</p>

<p><strong>To calculate the checksum:</strong></p>

<p>
  Add the bytes and ignore the carry to keep the checksum as 8 bits
</p>

<p>
  <strong>10111010</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>The sender sends:</strong></p>

<p>
  01101101&nbsp;&nbsp;10000001&nbsp;&nbsp;10001000&nbsp;&nbsp;10111010 (checksum)
</p>

<p>
  The checksum value is then sent along with the data.
</p>

<h4>Step 2: Data and Checksum are Sent</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The data bytes and the checksum are transmitted to the receiver.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Receiver Verifies the Checksum</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The same sum is done at the receiving end and the results compared.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why Use Checksum?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Detects errors in data transmission.</li>
  <li>Simple and efficient for detecting single-bit and some multi-bit errors.</li>
  <li>Cannot correct errors — only detects them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Checksum is widely used in <strong>networking (TCP/IP)</strong>, <strong>file transfers</strong>, and
  <strong>storage systems</strong> to ensure reliable data communication.
</p>

<h3>Serial vs Parallel Transmission</h3>

<h4>Serial Transmission</h4>

<p>
  Serial transmission sends data <strong>one bit at a time</strong> using a single wire.
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>
  Sending <strong>101111010</strong> as:<br>
  1 → 0 → 1 → 1 → 1 → 1 → 0 → 1 → 0
</p>

<p>
  Slower but reliable for long distances.
</p>

<h4>Parallel Transmission</h4>

<p>
  Parallel transmission sends <strong>multiple bits at the same time</strong> using multiple wires.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Example:</strong> Sending <strong>101111010</strong> all at once through 8 wires.</li>
  <li>Faster but can cause errors over long distances (over 10m).</li>
  <li>Used for printers and scanners that need fast data transfer but are close to the computer.</li>
</ul>

                <h3>Protocols and TCP/IP stack</h3>

<h3>Remember This Definition</h3>

<p>
  A <strong>protocol</strong> is a set of rules and standards that define how data is transmitted
  and communicated between devices in a network.
</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>

<p>
  Setting standards and rules that all manufacturers of hardware and software follow is important
  for a number of reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standards describe accurately and unambiguously how information is transmitted.</li>
  <li>A manufacturer’s products will work successfully with other manufacturers’ products if they all follow the same standards.</li>
  <li>By defining a set of standards, you provide a framework within which manufacturers can design new, successful products.</li>
  <li>Standards break down complex ideas into smaller, methodical, easier-to-understand components.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Successful communication includes:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What baud rate will be used – it determines how fast data is sent and received.</li>
  <li>What error checking will be used – checksums or parity checking.</li>
  <li>Whether software or hardware handshaking is to be used – handshaking is the process of establishing communication between devices.</li>
  <li>What character set is to be used (ASCII or UNICODE).</li>
  <li>How many bits will be used for data.</li>
  <li>How many control bits will be used to control data transfer (start bit – signals the beginning of a data packet, stop bit – marks the end of the data packet).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Logical and Physical Protocols</h4>

<p>
  A <strong>logical protocol</strong> refers to a set of rules and standards that define how data is
  transmitted, processed, and understood within a network at a logical level, without focusing on
  the physical hardware or infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  For example: <strong>IP, TCP, HTTP</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Physical protocols</strong> define how data is actually transmitted through the physical
  medium. Deals with the hardware and physical signals.
</p>

<p>
  For example: <strong>Ethernet and Wi-Fi</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Common Network Protocols</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong> – Sends web pages over the internet at the application layer.</li>
  <li><strong>HTTPS (Secure HTTP)</strong> – Encrypts HTTP data using TLS/SSL for secure web browsing.</li>
  <li><strong>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</strong> – Transfers files between a client and server. FTPS adds security.</li>
  <li><strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</strong> – Ensures reliable, ordered data transmission.</li>
  <li><strong>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</strong> – A faster alternative to TCP. Focuses on speed rather than guaranteed delivery, ideal for video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP calls.</li>
  <li><strong>IP (Internet Protocol)</strong> – Handles addressing and routing of data packets over networks.</li>
  <li><strong>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</strong> – Sends emails between clients and servers.</li>
  <li><strong>POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)</strong> – Downloads emails from a server to a local device.</li>
  <li><strong>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)</strong> – Allows email access and synchronisation across multiple devices.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
<h3>TCP/IP</h3>
          <p>    TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is a set of networking protocols that work together to send data across networks.

        <h3>Keeping Data Secure</h3>
        <h3>Data Protection and Network Security</h3>

<p>
  The <strong>Data Protection Act 1998</strong> requires organisations to keep data safe.
  Security measures include <strong>firewalls</strong>, <strong>proxy servers</strong>,
  <strong>encryption</strong>, and <strong>authentication</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Firewall</h4>

<p>
  A <strong>firewall</strong> blocks unauthorised access to a system. It allows only approved
  users to access certain data while keeping others out.
</p>

<h4>Proxy Server</h4>

<p>
  A <strong>proxy server</strong> sits between users and the main server. It checks user
  permissions before granting access to data, adding an extra layer of security.
</p>

<h4>How it Works:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>A user requests data.</li>
  <li>The firewall checks if the user has permission.</li>
  <li>If valid, the proxy server retrieves the data and sends it back.</li>
  <li>Users cannot access the main server directly.</li>
</ol>

<h4>VPN</h4>

<p>
  Public Wi-Fi is risky, so encrypt your communications for safety.
</p>

<p><strong>Best solution:</strong> Use a <strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Encrypts all your internet activity.</li>
  <li>Hides your IP address (useful for accessing geo-restricted content).</li>
  <li>Costs just a few pounds per month.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Install VPN software.</li>
  <li>Connect to a public network.</li>
  <li>The VPN verifies your identity and encrypts data.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Important Note</h4>

<p>
  No system is <strong>100% secure</strong>!
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check VPN terms — some providers log data.</li>
  <li>Employees at VPN companies could still pose risks.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>DNS</h3>
        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable website addresses (URLs) into numerical IP addresses, which computers use to communicate over the internet. The process involves multiple steps:</p>

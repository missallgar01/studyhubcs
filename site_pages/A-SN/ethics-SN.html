    <h2>Computing Related Legislation</h2>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>The Data Protection Act (1998) / GDPR</h3>
      <p>
        Data protection law governs how personal data about living individuals is collected,
        stored, processed, and shared.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Personal data</strong> is any data that can identify a person directly or indirectly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name, address, email address</li>
        <li>IP address combined with other data</li>
        <li>Medical or employment records</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A school storing student names, grades, and medical conditions must ensure the data
        is accurate, kept secure, and not shared without permission.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>The Eight Data Protection Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Data must be processed fairly and lawfully</li>
        <li>Used only for specific, legitimate purposes</li>
        <li>Adequate, relevant, and not excessive</li>
        <li>Accurate and kept up to date</li>
        <li>Not kept longer than necessary</li>
        <li>Processed in line with data subject rights</li>
        <li>Protected against unauthorised access or loss</li>
        <li>Not transferred outside protected regions without safeguards</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A company collecting email addresses for password recovery must not later use
        them for marketing unless consent is given.

<!-- ===================================================== -->

    <div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>1.5.2 Moral & Ethical Issues</h3>

  <p>
    Moral and ethical issues arise when the use of computer systems
    affects individuals, society, or the environment.
    Designers and organisations must consider the impact of technology
    on people’s rights, wellbeing, and opportunities.
  </p>
</div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Computers in the Workforce</h3>

      <p>
        Computers and automation can replace human jobs but can also create
        new employment opportunities.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Robots replacing factory workers</li>
        <li>Self-checkout machines reducing cashier jobs</li>

        <li>Automation increasing productivity but reducing employment</li>
        <li>New technology jobs in software development and cybersecurity</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Automated Decision Making</h3>

      <p>
        Automated decision-making systems use algorithms to make decisions
        without human intervention, which can lead to bias or unfair outcomes.

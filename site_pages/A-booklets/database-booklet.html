      <h3>Relational Databases</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>relational database</strong> stores data in multiple tables.
        Each table represents a different <strong>entity</strong>, such as a customer,
        product, or doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tables are linked together using keys, allowing data to be shared without duplication.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A hospital database may contain a <em>Doctor</em> table and a <em>Patient</em> table.
        These are linked using a DoctorID so each patient can be associated with a doctor.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Entities and Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        An <strong>entity</strong> is something about which data is stored.
        <strong>Attributes</strong> are properties describing that entity.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <pre>
Car(CarID, Age, Price)
        </pre>
        <p>
          Here, <em>Car</em> is the entity and <em>CarID</em>, <em>Age</em>, and <em>Price</em>
          are attributes.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Flat File Databases</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>flat file database</strong> stores all data in a single table.
        It is usually based on one entity.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Simple to create</li>
        <li>Hard to maintain</li>
        <li>High data redundancy</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <table>
          <tr><th>CarID</th><th>Age</th><th>Price</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Car1</td><td>5 years</td><td>£1500</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Car2</td><td>2 years</td><td>£2400</td></tr>
        </table>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Primary Keys</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>primary key</strong> uniquely identifies each record in a table.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Must be unique</li>
        <li>Must not be null</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        In the Car table, <code>CarID</code> is the primary key because no two cars share the same ID.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Foreign Keys</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>foreign key</strong> links two tables together.
        It is a primary key in one table that appears in another table.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        <em>DoctorID</em> is the primary key in the Doctor table and a foreign key
        in the Patient table.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Secondary Keys</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>secondary key</strong> is used to speed up searching.
        It does not uniquely identify records.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        Patients may be searched by surname rather than PatientID,
        so surname is indexed as a secondary key.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Entity Relationship Modelling (ERM)</h3>
      <p>
        Entity relationship models show how tables are linked.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>One-to-one</strong> – one record links to one record</li>
        <li><strong>One-to-many</strong> – one record links to many</li>
        <li><strong>Many-to-many</strong> – many records link to many</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        One customer can place many orders (one-to-many).
        Students and courses form a many-to-many relationship.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Normalisation</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Normalisation</strong> is the process of designing a database to reduce redundancy
        and improve data integrity.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Remove duplicate data</li>
        <li>Ensure consistent data</li>
        <li>Allow safe insertion and deletion</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Every table must have a <strong>primary key</strong></li>
            <li>All field names must be <strong>unique</strong></li>
            <li>Values in fields must be from the <strong>same domain</strong></li>
            <li>Values must be <strong>atomic</strong> (one data item per field)</li>
            <li><strong>No two records may be identical</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </td>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Indexing</h3>
      <p>
        Indexing stores records in a specific order to speed up searches.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Primary keys are indexed automatically</li>
        <li>Secondary keys are indexed for fast searching</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Capturing Data</h3>
      <p>
        Data must be captured accurately and efficiently.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Manual entry</li>
        <li>OCR – Optical Character Recognition</li>
        <li>OMR – Optical Mark Recognition</li>
        <li>MICR – Magnetic Ink Character Recognition</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        Banks use MICR to read cheque numbers, but the amount is entered manually.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Selecting and Managing Data</h3>
      <p>
        Not all collected data is needed.
        Selecting relevant data reduces processing overhead.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A speed camera only records vehicles exceeding the speed limit,
        ignoring all others.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Exchanging Data</h3>
      <p>
        Data exchange is the transfer of data between systems.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>EDI – Electronic Data Interchange</li>
        <li>No human interaction required</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A supermarket automatically sends stock data to suppliers using EDI.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>SQL (Structured Query Language)</h3>
      <p>
        SQL is a <strong>declarative language</strong> used to manage relational databases.
      </p>

      <p><strong>SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY</strong></p>
      <pre>
SELECT MovieTitle, DatePublished
FROM Movie
WHERE DatePublished BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2005-12-31'
ORDER BY DatePublished DESC;
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>JOIN</h3>
      <p>
        JOIN combines data from multiple tables using a common attribute.
      </p>

      <pre>
SELECT Movie.MovieTitle, Director.DirectorName
FROM Movie
JOIN Director
ON Movie.DirectorName = Director.DirectorName;
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>CREATE, ALTER, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE</h3>

      <pre>
CREATE TABLE Student (
  StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
);
      </pre>

      <pre>
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, 'Alex');
      </pre>

      <pre>
UPDATE Student SET Name='Alexa' WHERE StudentID=1;
      </pre>

      <pre>
DELETE FROM Student WHERE StudentID=1;
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Referential Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        Referential integrity ensures linked data remains consistent.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A customer record cannot be deleted if active orders depend on it.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Transaction Processing and ACID</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Atomicity</strong> – all or nothing</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency</strong> – maintains database rules</li>
        <li><strong>Isolation</strong> – transactions don’t interfere</li>
        <li><strong>Durability</strong> – changes persist after failure</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A bank transfer must either fully complete or not occur at all.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Record Locking and Deadlock</h3>
      <p>
        Record locking prevents simultaneous updates.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Deadlock Example:</strong><br>
        User A locks record 1 and waits for record 2.
        User B locks record 2 and waits for record 1.
        Neither can proceed.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Redundancy</h3>
      <p>
        Redundancy stores multiple copies of data in different locations.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        Cloud backups ensure data can be recovered after hardware failure.

  <h3>Question 1</h3>

  <p>
    Rosa has recently opened a new leisure centre. Currently she has 150 members,
    however, she is estimating that this will increase to around 10 000 members.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rosa will store members' details in a database. She will also store gym class
    bookings and appointments with fitness instructors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rosa is considering using either a flat file database or a relational database.
  </p>

  <p>
    Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of flat file databases and relational databases
    and which one would be the most suitable for Rosa.
  </p>

  <p>You should include the following in your answer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The features of flat file databases and relational databases</li>
    <li>The benefits and drawbacks of each type of database</li>
    <li>Which type of database would be the most suitable for Rosa</li>
  </ul>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>

  <div class="answer">
    <p><strong>Flat file database:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stores all data in a single table or file</li>
      <li>Easy to set up and suitable for small amounts of data</li>
      <li>Can contain redundant (repeated) data</li>
      <li>Harder to manage and expand as data grows</li>
      <li>Searching can be slower with large datasets</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Relational database:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stores data across multiple related tables</li>
      <li>Uses primary keys and foreign keys to link data</li>
      <li>Reduces data duplication</li>
      <li>Easier to maintain, update, and expand</li>
      <li>More secure and efficient for large datasets</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Conclusion:</strong> A relational database is the most suitable for Rosa
      because the number of members is expected to grow significantly, and it will
      efficiently manage bookings and appointments while maintaining data integrity.

    <p><strong>(i) Durable means:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Committed transaction data is not lost…</li>
      <li>…even in case of power/system failure.</li>

  <h3>Question 6</h3>

  <div class="question">
    <p><strong>6(a).</strong> A hotel uses a computer system to keep track of room bookings. The hotel staff are able to query a database to discover which rooms are booked or which rooms are free.</p>
    <p>The hotel’s computer network uses a <strong>client-server</strong> model.</p>

    <p><strong>i.</strong> Describe what is meant by the term ‘client-server’ in this context. <strong>[3]</strong></p>
    <p><strong>ii.</strong> Give two advantages of client-server compared to peer-to-peer. <strong>[2]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>(b).</strong> The hotel’s network uses multiple switches. Explain the purpose of a network switch. <strong>[3]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>(c).* </strong>The hotel is concerned about the security of its computer network. Discuss the threats which potentially exist to the hotel’s computer network and how these threats could be eliminated or reduced. <strong>[9]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>(d).</strong> The hotel stores data about rooms, customers and bookings in a database. Each customer can book multiple rooms and each room can be booked multiple times.</p>
    <p><strong>i.</strong> Draw an Entity Relationship Diagram for this database. <strong>[4]</strong></p>
    <p><strong>ii.</strong> Define what is meant by the term ‘foreign key’, giving one example of where a foreign key would be used in the hotel booking database. <strong>[3]</strong></p>
    <p><strong>iii.</strong> Describe two different ways that hashing could be used in this database. <strong>[4]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>(e).</strong> The hotel booking database enforces referential integrity. Explain what is meant by the term ‘referential integrity’ and how this could potentially be broken. <strong>[2]</strong></p>

  <div class="answer" hidden>
    <p><strong>6(a)(i) Client-server (3 marks):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client computers connect to a server.</li>
      <li>The server provides access to a resource/service.</li>
      <li>Here: hotel staff use client machines to query the database hosted on the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>6(a)(ii) Any two advantages (2 marks):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Easier to manage users/access centrally.</li>
      <li>Easier to back up centrally.</li>
      <li>Easier to keep data secure centrally.</li>
      <li>Technicians can remotely install/monitor.</li>
      <li>(Also commonly credited) only one point of failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>6(b) Purpose of a switch (3 marks):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connects computers/devices together on a LAN.</li>
      <li>Receives packets and uses the destination MAC address in the header.</li>
      <li>Forwards frames out of the correct port to the intended device (not broadcast to all like a hub).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>6(c)* Threats + mitigation (indicative points for a high-mark answer):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Malware/viruses</strong> can damage systems/data → anti-malware, updates, least privilege.</li>
      <li><strong>Spyware/keyloggers</strong> can capture credentials → endpoint protection, staff training, MFA.</li>
      <li><strong>Phishing</strong> steals data via fake messages → staff education, filters, verification processes.</li>
      <li><strong>DoS/DDoS</strong> can disrupt bookings → rate limiting, firewalls, DDoS protection services.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>firewalls</strong>, patching, device restrictions (e.g. USB), segmented/restricted Wi-Fi.</li>
      <li>Balance security measures with customer experience (e.g. guest IT access).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>6(d)(i) ERD (4 marks) — textual equivalent:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Entities: <strong>Customer</strong>, <strong>Room</strong>, <strong>Booking</strong> (singular names).</li>
      <li>Links: Customer → Booking is <strong>one-to-many</strong>; Room → Booking is <strong>one-to-many</strong>.</li>
      <li>No direct Customer–Room link (Booking acts as the link).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>6(d)(ii) Foreign key (3 marks):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A field that links to the (primary) key in a second table.</li>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> CustomerID (or RoomID) stored in the Booking table.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>6(d)(iii) Hashing uses (4 marks):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> hash passwords in the database so they can’t be read if stolen.</li>
      <li><strong>Direct access/indexing:</strong> use a hash of an index/key to quickly locate Customer/Room/Booking records.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>6(e) Referential integrity (2 marks):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Foreign keys must reference an existing/valid primary key (relationships remain consistent).</li>
      <li>It can be broken if a primary key is deleted/updated without cascading, leaving orphan foreign keys.</li>

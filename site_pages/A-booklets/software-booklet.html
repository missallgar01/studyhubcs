        <h3>Open Source vs Closed Source Software</h3>
        <p><strong>Open source</strong> software makes the source code available so that users can view, modify and share it. <strong>Closed source</strong> (proprietary) software keeps the source code secret and is usually licensed for a fee.</p>

        <table>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>Functions of an Operating System</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provides a <strong>user interface</strong> (GUI, CLI, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Manages memory</strong> (allocates and deallocates RAM).</li>
          <li><strong>Manages the processor</strong> (scheduling tasks on the CPU).</li>
          <li><strong>Manages devices</strong> via device drivers.</li>
          <li><strong>Manages files</strong> on secondary storage.</li>
          <li>Provides <strong>security</strong> and access control.</li>
          <li>Provides and coordinates <strong>utility software</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>Types of Operating System</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single-user</strong> – only one user can log in at a time.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-user</strong> – many users share a powerful computer (e.g. mainframe).</li>
          <li><strong>Multitasking</strong> – appears to run many programs at once by quickly switching between them.</li>
          <li><strong>Distributed</strong> – processing is spread over multiple computers working together.</li>
          <li><strong>Embedded</strong> – built into a device with a dedicated role (e.g. washing machine, router).</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time</strong> – guarantees responses within a strict time limit for safety-critical tasks.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>Memory Management, Paging, Segmentation & Virtual Memory</h3>
        <p><strong>Memory management</strong> controls how RAM is allocated to processes, ensuring they do not interfere with each other and that memory is used efficiently.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Paging</strong> – memory is split into fixed-size pages; processes are split into pages which can be loaded into any free frame.</li>
          <li><strong>Segmentation</strong> – memory is split into variable-sized segments representing logical divisions such as code, data and stack.</li>
          <li><strong>Virtual memory</strong> – uses backing store (secondary storage) as if it were extra RAM, swapping pages in and out when needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disk thrashing</strong> occurs if the system spends more time swapping pages in and out of virtual memory than doing useful work, often causing serious slow-down.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>BIOS, Interrupts, Scheduling & Virtual Machines</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>BIOS</strong> (Basic Input/Output System) is firmware stored on the motherboard. On startup it performs POST (Power-On Self-Test) and then loads the operating system.</li>
          <li><strong>Interrupt</strong> – a signal that temporarily halts the CPU so that a more urgent task (handled by an Interrupt Service Routine) can run.</li>
          <li><strong>Scheduling</strong> – the OS decides which process runs next. Algorithms include Round Robin, First Come First Served, and Shortest Job First.</li>
          <li><strong>Virtual machine</strong> – a software emulation of a computer, running its own OS in a sandboxed environment on top of a host system.</li>
        </ul>

            <p><strong>Similarity:</strong> Both are ways of partitioning memory and can be used with virtual memory.<br>

          <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
          <div class="answer">
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Each ready process is given a fixed time slice of CPU time in turn. When its time slice ends, it goes to the back of the queue and the next process runs.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Fair – each process gets regular CPU time; good for time-sharing systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> If the time slice is too small there is lots of context switching, which reduces efficiency. Long jobs may take a long time to complete.</p>

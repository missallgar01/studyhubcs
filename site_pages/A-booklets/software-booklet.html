        <h3>System Software vs Application Software</h3>
        <p><strong>System software</strong> enables the computer to operate, controls hardware and provides a platform for applications (for example, the operating system, utilities and device drivers).</p>

        <p>Think of software like a recipe.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Open Source Software (OSS)</strong> – the “shared recipe”. Source code can be viewed, modified and redistributed. Good for collaboration, transparency and customisation.</li>
          <li><strong>Closed Source Software (CSS)</strong> – the “secret recipe”. Source code is hidden and proprietary. Usually sold under licence with professional support.</li>

        <h3>Purposes & Types of Operating Systems</h3>
        <p><strong>Operating system</strong> – a set of programs that manage hardware and provide a platform for application software.</p>
          <p><img src="/images/software.png"/></p>
          <p><strong>Main purposes include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Controlling hardware / resource management.</li>
          <li>Providing a platform for applications and file storage.</li>
          <li>Providing a user interface.</li>
          <li>Handling communication with other systems (protocols).</li>
          <li>Translating code (e.g. via compilers / interpreters).</li>
          <li>Providing utilities / housekeeping programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Types of OS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single-user</strong> – one user at a time.</li>
          <li><strong>Multitasking</strong> – apparently runs several programs at once by sharing processor time.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-user</strong> – many users share one powerful computer via terminals.</li>
          <li><strong>Distributed</strong> – several computers work together on one job.</li>
          <li><strong>Embedded</strong> – dedicated, read-only, built into devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time</strong> – guarantees responses within a fixed maximum time; used in time-critical systems.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>Interfaces</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GUI</strong> – windows, icons, menus; pointer used to select; intuitive for most users.</li>
          <li><strong>Form-based</strong> – user completes fields; common in data entry systems; reduces errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Menu-based</strong> – user chooses from limited options; good for kiosks / tourist info.</li>
          <li><strong>Natural Language Interface (NLI)</strong> – user types or speaks in everyday language; used in virtual assistants and expert systems.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>Memory Management, Paging, Segmentation & Virtual Memory</h3>
        <p><strong>Memory management</strong> allocates and deallocates RAM so multiple programs can run safely and efficiently.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="""images/paging.png"/><strong>Paging</strong> – splits memory into equal-sized pages (physical divisions). Processes are divided into pages that can be stored non-contiguously.</li>
            <li><img src="""images/segmentation.png"/><strong>Segmentation</strong> – splits memory into variable-sized segments (logical divisions) such as code, data and stack.</li>
          <li><strong>Virtual memory</strong> – uses an area of secondary storage as an extension of RAM. Pages not currently needed are swapped out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disk thrashing</strong> – when the computer spends more time swapping pages between RAM and disk than doing useful processing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>BIOS, Interrupts, Scheduling & Virtual Machines</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>BIOS</strong> – Basic Input/Output System firmware stored in ROM on the motherboard. Performs POST (Power-On Self-Test) then loads the OS (bootstraps).</li>
          <li><strong>Interrupt</strong> – a signal to the CPU that a device or process needs attention. Causes the CPU to pause its current task and run an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).</li>
          <li><strong>Scheduling</strong> – the OS decides which job uses the CPU next. Algorithms include First Come, First Served; Round Robin; Shortest Job First; Multi-Level Feedback Queues.</li>
          <li><strong>Virtual machine (VM)</strong> – a software emulation of a computer that runs its own OS in an isolated environment.</li>

            <p><strong>(b)</strong> An area of backing store (e.g. hard disk) is used as if it were main memory. The OS uses paging to swap pages between RAM and this storage so that pages currently needed are in RAM and others are held on disk.</p>
            <p><strong>(c)</strong> Disk thrashing occurs when so many page swaps are taking place that the computer spends more time transferring pages between RAM and disk than doing real processing. Because the disk is relatively slow, performance collapses and the system may appear to hang.</p>

            <p><strong>(a)</strong> A virtual machine is software that behaves like a complete computer system, emulating hardware so it can run its own operating system and applications.</p>
            <p><strong>(b) Key discussion points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>VMs of different consoles allow the programmer to test the game for each platform on one development machine instead of needing multiple physical consoles.</li>
              <li>VMs can provide safe, isolated environments for testing possibly unstable builds.</li>
              <li>The game could be written in a language that compiles to intermediate code which runs on a VM; the same code can then run on different hardware with suitable VMs.</li>
              <li>This saves time and cost (one codebase for many platforms) but the game may run more slowly than native compiled code.</li>
              <li>VMs require a powerful host machine and must accurately emulate the target hardware; otherwise the final code may not behave the same on real consoles.</li>

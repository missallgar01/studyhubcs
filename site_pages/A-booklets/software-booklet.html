        <p><strong>Operating system</strong> – a set of programs that manage hardware and provide a platform for application software.</p>
          <p><img src="images/software/software.png"/></p>
          <p><strong>Main purposes include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Controlling hardware / resource management.</li>
          <li>Providing a platform for applications and file storage.</li>
          <li>Providing a user interface.</li>
          <li>Handling communication with other systems (protocols).</li>
          <li>Translating code (e.g. via compilers / interpreters).</li>
          <li>Providing utilities / housekeeping programs.</li>
        </ul>


        <p><strong>Types of OS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single-user</strong> – one user at a time.</li>
          <li><strong>Multitasking</strong> – apparently runs several programs at once by sharing processor time.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-user</strong> – many users share one powerful computer via terminals.</li>
          <li><strong>Distributed</strong> – several computers work together on one job.</li>
          <li><strong>Embedded</strong> – dedicated, read-only, built into devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time</strong> – guarantees responses within a fixed maximum time; used in time-critical systems.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>Interfaces</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GUI</strong> – windows, icons, menus; pointer used to select; intuitive for most users.</li>
          <li><strong>Form-based</strong> – user completes fields; common in data entry systems; reduces errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Menu-based</strong> – user chooses from limited options; good for kiosks / tourist info.</li>

    <li>
      BIOS refers to the <strong>Basic Input/Output System</strong> of a computer
    </li>
    <li>
      BIOS is a piece of <strong>firmware</strong> stored on a small memory chip
      on the motherboard
    </li>
    <li>
      On system start, the BIOS is the <strong>first software to run</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      It performs a <strong>POST (Power-On Self-Test)</strong>, a diagnostic
      testing sequence that ensures all the hardware components are working properly
    </li>

      If the BIOS encounters any errors during this test, it will either
      <strong>halt the boot process</strong> or issue an <strong>error message</strong>

  <h2>Interrupt handling</h2>
     <h3><strong>Interrupt</strong> – a signal to the CPU that a device or process needs attention. Causes the CPU to pause its current task and run an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>START</strong> &nbsp;
    <strong>REGISTERS</strong> &nbsp;
    <strong>PRIORITY</strong> &nbsp;
    <strong>STACK</strong> &nbsp;
    <strong>ISR</strong> &nbsp;
    <strong>FLAG</strong>
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Interrupt checked for at <strong>start/end</strong> of each
      <strong>fetch-execute cycle</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      If the interrupt is of a lower or equal <strong>priority</strong>
      to the current process, then the current process continues
    </li>
    <li>
      If interrupt raised, contents of <strong>registers</strong>
      are copied to the <strong>stack</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flags</strong> are set to determine if interrupts are
      enabled or disabled
    </li>
    <li>
      Program Counter is changed to point to the
      <strong>Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)</strong>
      &mdash; the ISR runs
    </li>
    <li>
      After interrupt completion, previous register values are
      restored from the <strong>stack</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flag</strong> is reset
    </li>
    <li>
      If a higher priority interrupt is received while servicing
      an interrupt…
    </li>
    <li>
      …this is added to the <strong>stack</strong> and the new
      interrupt is dealt with
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The <strong>ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)</strong> is software —
    it is the function/code that runs when an interrupt occurs.
    <strong>Loading the ISR</strong> means starting the correct piece
    of code to handle the interrupt.
  </p>

  <h3>Example ISRs</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Timer interrupt</strong> – Every 1 ms or 1 s, the timer triggers
      and the ISR toggles an LED or updates a clock
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Keyboard interrupt</strong> – A key is pressed, the keyboard
      hardware signals the CPU, and the ISR reads the key
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Network packet received</strong> – A new packet arrives at the
      Ethernet port and the ISR quickly moves it into a buffer
    </li>

     <h2>Scheduling algorithms</h2>

  <p>The purpose of scheduling is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make efficient use of processor time</li>
    <li>Make efficient use of resources</li>
    <li>Maximise the number of users</li>
    <li>Ensure that there is no apparent delay for users</li>
    <li>Maximise throughput of the CPU</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why scheduling is used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maximise number of users</li>
    <li>…with no apparent delay</li>
    <li>Maximise number of jobs processed</li>
    <li>…as quickly as possible</li>
    <li>Obtain efficient use of processor time / resources</li>
    <li>…dependent upon priorities</li>
    <li>
      …to ensure all jobs obtain processor time /
      long jobs do not monopolise the processor
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Explain why operating systems use scheduling</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure all tasks are processed</li>
    <li>…by changing priorities where necessary</li>
    <li>Process as many jobs as possible</li>
    <li>…in the least possible time</li>
    <li>Maximise number of interactive users</li>
    <li>…receiving fast response times</li>

    Round robin scheduling is one method that may be used by a

  <h2>Device Drivers</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A device driver is a piece of software that enables communication
      between an operating system and specific hardware devices such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Printers</li>
        <li>Graphics cards</li>
        <li>Network cards</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Device drivers allow the operating system to control and interact
      with those devices
    </li>

    <li>
      Because many external devices have embedded system software,
      a driver bridges the gap between a major operating system and
      a small hardware operating system
    </li>

    <li>
      Device drivers make it possible to perform specific operations
      on the hardware, e.g. a printer driver enables the operating
      system to send print commands and manage print jobs
    </li>

    <li>
      Most hardware manufacturers write their own device driver
      software, meaning a single operating system may have several
      printer drivers installed

            <p><strong>(b)</strong> An area of backing store (e.g. hard disk) is used as if it were main memory. The OS uses paging to swap pages between RAM and this storage so that pages currently needed are in RAM and others are held on disk.</p>
            <p><strong>(c)</strong> Disk thrashing occurs when so many page swaps are taking place that the computer spends more time transferring pages between RAM and disk than doing real processing. Because the disk is relatively slow, performance collapses and the system may appear to hang.</p>

            <p><strong>(b) Key discussion points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>VMs of different consoles allow the programmer to test the game for each platform on one development machine instead of needing multiple physical consoles.</li>
              <li>VMs can provide safe, isolated environments for testing possibly unstable builds.</li>
              <li>The game could be written in a language that compiles to intermediate code which runs on a VM; the same code can then run on different hardware with suitable VMs.</li>
              <li>This saves time and cost (one codebase for many platforms) but the game may run more slowly than native compiled code.</li>
              <li>VMs require a powerful host machine and must accurately emulate the target hardware; otherwise the final code may not behave the same on real consoles.</li>

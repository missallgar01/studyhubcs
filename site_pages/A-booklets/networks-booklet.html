  <div class="answer">
    <p><strong>Indicative mark scheme points:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Peer-to-peer (P2P):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Computers connect as equals; each machine can share its own resources (files/printers/storage/internet).</li>
      <li>Security/login is managed per-machine; little central administration needed.</li>
      <li>If a computer is switched off, any resources it shares become unavailable.</li>
      <li>Easy/cheap to add another machine (good for small/quick growth).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Client-server:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clients connect to a server that provides network services (e.g., central storage, authentication, printing).</li>
      <li>Centralised security and user management; shared resources not dependent on a staff PC being on.</li>
      <li>Requires more specialist setup/admin (cost + IT skills/time).</li>
      <li>If the server fails, key network functionality (including login/services) can be lost.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Suitability (apply to scenario):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>For a small office with up to five staff, P2P can be cheaper and flexible to expand quickly.</li>
      <li>Because accountancy data is sensitive, client-server can be more suitable due to stronger centralised security and controlled shared storage.</li>

        <li>Relationships are consistent: each foreign key must match an existing/valid primary key.</li>
        <li>Can be broken if a primary key is deleted/changed without cascading, leaving foreign keys pointing to non-existent records.</li>

        In order to view a website, a user enters a website address into their web browser
        such as <code>http://www.ocr.org.uk</code>.
        The website will then be displayed onto the user’s screen.
      </p>

        Explain how the <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> plays a role in websites being loaded. [4]

      <ul>
        <li>The browser needs to find the <strong>IP address</strong> that corresponds to the domain name.</li>
        <li>A request is sent to a <strong>DNS resolver</strong> (often provided by the ISP).</li>
        <li>The resolver checks its <strong>cache</strong>; if not found, it queries other DNS servers:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Top Level Domain (TLD) name server</li>
          <li>Authoritative name server</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The correct IP address is returned to the client.</li>
        <li>The browser then uses this IP address to connect to the web server and load the website.</li>

    <h3>Stage 8 — Q8</h3>

    <div class="question">
      <p>
        *A company has six solicitors working in two offices in different locations. They work with the general public
        and help them solve any sensitive legal issues they may be facing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solicitors would like to set up a computer network to allow them to work together more effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of computer networking to the company.
        You should refer to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Different networking methods</li>
        <li>Cost implications</li>
        <li>Security implications</li>

      <p><strong>Indicative content (MS themes):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Two offices → likely need a <strong>WAN</strong> connecting two <strong>LANs</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Client-server</strong> supports centralised security, backup, shared resources (but needs server hardware/admin → cost).</li>
        <li><strong>VPN</strong> can secure links between offices; encryption needed for sensitive case data.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud storage</strong> enables sharing/remote access and scalable storage, but data is more “out of firm control”.</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> shared files, collaboration, access case files from either office, shared printers/internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Security risks:</strong> increased attack surface; must protect confidential/legal data (strong access control, encryption, policies).</li>
        <li><strong>Costs:</strong> routers/switches/servers/cabling/WAP; ongoing IT support; security measures increase costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> networking improves effectiveness but must be justified against cost and strict security needs.</li>
      </ul>

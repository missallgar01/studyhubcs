    <p>Three principles of the Data Protection Act include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal data must be processed <strong>fairly and lawfully</strong>.</li>

  <h3>3. Question</h3>

  <p>
    The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (2000) has been described as both a vital legal tool to ensure the public’s safety and an attack on an individual’s freedoms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Evaluate the purpose and use of the Act.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should include:
    <br>• the additional powers given under the Act
    <br>• to whom these powers are given
    <br>• the perceived benefits and/or drawbacks of the Act.
  </p>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) gives authorities additional powers to monitor and intercept electronic communications such as emails, phone calls and internet activity. It also allows organisations to demand access to communications data and, in some cases, require individuals or companies to hand over encryption keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      These powers are given to organisations such as the police, security services, local councils and other public bodies. The purpose of the Act is to help prevent and investigate serious crimes such as terrorism and organised crime, improving public safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      A benefit of RIPA is that it allows law enforcement agencies to detect and disrupt criminal activity before harm occurs. However, a major drawback is that it can be seen as an invasion of privacy, as innocent individuals may have their communications monitored. Some believe the wide range of organisations with access to these powers makes misuse more likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, while RIPA helps protect national security, it raises ethical concerns about civil liberties and personal privacy.

  <h3>4. Question</h3>

  <p>
    The Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 applies to all videos that are streamed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Explain how this act applies to the videos.
  </p>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      The Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 gives automatic copyright protection to the creator of the video. This means others cannot legally copy, distribute or use the video without permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Streaming services must have permission or licences to show the videos, and copyright holders can request removal if their content is used without authorisation.
    </p>

  <h3>5. Question</h3>

  <p>
    Many technologists predict that in the future, shops on the high street will use facial recognition to identify customers before they walk into a shop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Discuss the possible benefits and drawbacks of technology being used in this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should refer to:
    <br>• the benefits and drawbacks to both customers and businesses
    <br>• moral and ethical issues
    <br>• legal issues
  </p>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      Facial recognition could benefit customers by allowing personalised offers and faster service. Businesses could benefit from targeted advertising and better understanding of customer behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, customers may see this as an invasion of privacy and feel uncomfortable being tracked. There are moral and ethical concerns about loss of civil liberties and consent, especially if people are recorded without entering the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legally, businesses would need to comply with data protection laws by keeping data secure, accurate and only using it for specific purposes. Data breaches could damage trust and reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the technology could increase profits, the ethical and legal risks may outweigh the benefits if not carefully controlled.

  <h3>6. Question</h3>

  <p>
    “The Computer Misuse Act means that computer users are criminalised for simply trying to learn how systems work.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Discuss whether or not you agree with this statement.
  </p>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      The Computer Misuse Act makes unauthorised access to computer systems illegal, even if no harm is intended. This can make it seem like learning how systems work is criminalised.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the Act protects systems and users from hacking and misuse. Users are allowed to investigate systems if they have permission, such as ethical hackers or system owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the law does not prevent learning, but it requires authorisation to ensure systems are protected from harm.

  <h3>7. Question</h3>

  <p>
    “When it comes to government electronic surveillance, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Discuss whether or not you agree with this statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should include:
    <br>• to what extent the UK government is able to monitor electronic communications
    <br>• technical measures citizens can take to help prevent their communications being monitored.
  </p>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      The UK government can monitor electronic communications under laws such as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. This allows authorities to intercept messages if there is legal justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizens can use encryption, secure messaging apps and VPNs to reduce monitoring. However, authorities may still require access to encrypted data in some cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      While surveillance can improve security, it risks invading privacy. Even innocent people may wish to protect personal communications, so having “nothing to hide” does not remove concerns about freedom and civil liberties.

      <li>Examples: changing a social media post on a friend’s phone could potentially breach sections.</li>
      <li>Investigation can break the Act without intent (e.g. altering server logs through actions).</li>
      <li><strong>AO3:</strong> learning can be done via legitimate materials (e.g. tutorials) without unauthorised access.</li>
      <li>Investigating systems you own or have permission to access is legal; “learning” isn’t a valid excuse for breaching terms/law.</li>
      <li>Ethical/white-hat hackers operate with authorisation; grey/black hats do not.</li>

  <h3>5. Question</h3>
  <p class="qtext">
    “When it comes to government electronic surveillance, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.”<br><br>
    <strong>Discuss</strong> whether or not you agree with this statement. You should include:
    <br>• To what extent the UK government is able to monitor electronic communications of its citizens
    <br>• Technical measures citizens can take to help prevent their communications being monitored.

  <div class="answer">
    <p><strong>Indicative points (mark scheme):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AO1:</strong> Encryption scrambles data so intercepted data cannot be understood; requires a key to decrypt.</li>
      <li>Symmetric encryption uses one key (key exchange problem); asymmetric uses public/private keys (no need to exchange secret keys).</li>
      <li>RIPA can compel disclosure of encryption keys.</li>
      <li><strong>AO2:</strong> encrypted messages can’t be read without the key; RIPA can require decryption/handing over keys.</li>
      <li>Many messaging services use end-to-end encryption by default.</li>
      <li>VPNs can reroute traffic to attempt to escape monitoring.</li>
      <li>Encrypted traffic can still indicate two parties are exchanging secret info; steganography can hide the existence of encrypted data.</li>
      <li><strong>AO3:</strong> monitoring risks exposing private but non-illegal communications; restricting encryption harms legitimate security (e.g. banking).</li>
      <li>Monitoring “with just cause” vs routine monitoring (false positives); may reduce illegal coordination (terrorism/drug trafficking).</li>

  <h3>6. Question</h3>
  <p class="qtext">
    OCR Car Park would like to calculate the parking charges when a car leaves their car park.<br>
    They will need to record the time that a car enters and leaves their car park in order to calculate the parking
    charge.<br><br>
    <strong>Discuss</strong> the different methods that could be used to collect this data.<br>
    In your answer you should include:
    <br>• The benefits and drawbacks of each method
    <br>• Ethical implications
    <br>• Legal implications

  <div class="answer">
    <p><strong>Indicative points (mark scheme):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Methods:</strong> ANPR using OCR; token/ticket time-stamped on entry; staff manually record entry/exit times; sensors detect entry/exit; photos/video time-stamped on entry/exit.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits/Drawbacks:</strong> automatic systems can be more reliable, faster, and reduce staffing overheads; manual methods can be prone to human error.</li>
      <li>Data can feed an algorithm to calculate price from duration parked.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> users may see tracking/monitoring as invasion of privacy; civil liberty concerns.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal:</strong> if storing video/photos (may contain faces), must follow data protection legislation (secure storage, limited retention, only relevant data, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>Extra considerations:</strong> if connected to other databases (e.g. police/DVLA) could verify vehicles; internet-connected cameras increase hacking risk → security measures required.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> automation may improve satisfaction and reduce costs, but could reduce local employment; cameras may deter some users; data protection compliance should protect consumers.</li>

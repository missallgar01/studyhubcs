  <h3>Ethical Issues</h3>
  <p>
    An ethical issue is a situation that raises questions about what is right
    and wrong.
  </p>

  <h3>Social and Cultural Issues</h3>
  <p>
    Social and cultural issues include the digital divide, privacy concerns
    related to surveillance, and the impact of social media.

      <h3>Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        Personal data is information that can be used to identify an individual.
        Examples include data collected using GPS, facial recognition, number plate
        recognition, smart devices, surveys, and official government or medical
        services.
      </p>

      <h3>Privacy Issues in Computing</h3>
      <p>
        Privacy issues include facial recognition, GPS tracking, and internet
        monitoring. These raise concerns about who is collecting data, how it is
        used, and who has access to it.
      </p>

      <h3>Internet Monitoring</h3>
      <p>
        Schools, businesses, and social media companies use monitoring software to
        track activity. This can help prevent harmful behaviour but raises concerns
        about free speech, misuse, and biased systems.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>AI and Robotics Ethical Issues</h3>
      <p>
        Ethical concerns with AI and robotics include accountability, bias,
        safety, job displacement, and privacy.
      </p>

      <h4>Algorithmic Bias</h4>
      <p>
        Algorithmic bias can be caused by poor training data, human bias, or poor
        algorithm design. This can lead to discrimination and unfair outcomes.
      </p>

      <h4>Reducing Algorithmic Bias</h4>
      <p>
        Methods to reduce bias include human oversight, governance, and improving
        the quality of training data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Environmental Impact of Computing</h3>
      <p>
        Computing impacts the environment through energy use, extraction of raw
        materials, data centres, electronic waste, and frequent replacement cycles.
      </p>

      <h4>Reducing Environmental Impact</h4>
      <p>
        Environmental impact can be reduced by keeping devices longer, repairing
        them, reusing or donating devices, and keeping software updated.
      </p>
    </div>

     <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity is concerned with the protection of computer systems,
        computer networks, and data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its purpose is to protect computers and networks from cyberattacks,
        prevent unauthorised access, protect against damage caused by
        malicious software, prevent data theft, and protect against the
        disruption of services.
      </p>
        </div>

     <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Cyber Security Threats</h3>
      <p>
        Cyber security threats are actions or weaknesses that can damage,
        disrupt, or take control of computer systems or data.
      </p>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Computer Virus</strong></td>
          <td>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Trojan</strong></td>
          <td>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Adware</strong></td>
          <td>
            Automatically installs banners and pop-ups. Although it may not

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Phishing</strong></td>
          <td>
            An email or text message scam that tricks users into believing they are
            being contacted by a trusted organisation and encourages them to reveal
            sensitive information.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Pharming</strong></td>
          <td>

            them to enter sensitive information.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Blagging (Pretexting)</strong></td>
          <td>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Shoulder Surfing</strong></td>
          <td>

        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Brute Force Attacks</h3>
      <p>
        Brute force attacks attempt to gain access by trying every possible
        combination of passwords.
      </p>


      <h3>Weak Passwords</h3>
      <p>
        Weak passwords are easy to guess. Dictionary attacks use algorithms
        to systematically try common words until the password is cracked.
      </p>


      <h3>Default Passwords</h3>
      <p>
        Default passwords are given to users when accounts are created.
        If not changed, they pose a major security risk, especially when
        sent unencrypted via email.
      </p>


      <h3>Removable Media</h3>
      <p>
        Removable media such as USB pen drives can transmit malware between
        computer systems.
      </p>


      <h3>Unpatched or Outdated Software</h3>
      <p>
        Software that is not regularly updated remains vulnerable to attack
        because security vulnerabilities have not been fixed.
      </p>


      <h3>Misconfigured Access Rights</h3>
      <p>
        Users should only have access to files and data they need. Incorrect
        access rights can give users access they should not have.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Penetration testing is legitimate testing of an organisation’s
        computer systems to identify vulnerabilities so they can be fixed
        before an attacker exploits them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
      <h3>Preventing Cybersecurity Threats</h3>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity threats can be reduced using biometric measures,
        automatic software updates, secure password systems, email
        verification, and anti-virus software.
      </p>

      <h4>Methods of Preventing Cybersecurity Threats</h4>

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Biometric Security</strong></td>
          <td>
            Uses fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans to verify a user’s
            identity. Biometrics are more secure than passwords because they cannot
            be guessed or forgotten.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Automatic Software Updates</strong></td>
          <td>
            Keeps operating systems, firewalls, and antivirus software up to date
            to protect against new malware and recently discovered vulnerabilities.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Password Systems and Two-Factor Authentication</strong></td>
          <td>
            Enforces strong passwords that must be changed regularly. Two-factor
            authentication requires an additional check such as a second password
            or confirmation via phone.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Email Verification</strong></td>
          <td>
            Confirms a user’s identity by requiring them to activate a link sent
            to their email address.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Anti-Virus Software</strong></td>
          <td>
            Scans files against a database of known virus signatures. Detected
            malware is quarantined. Antivirus software must be regularly updated
            to detect new threats.

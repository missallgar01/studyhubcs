        <h3>Main CPU Components</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Control Unit (CU)</strong> – decodes instructions and sends signals to control how data moves around the CPU and memory.</li>
          <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</strong> – carries out calculations and logical comparisons (e.g. greater than, less than).</li>
          <li><strong>Clock</strong> – a signal to synchronise tasks. A clock cycle is known as a <em>tick</em>. Each cycle has a high state and a low state. For each tick of the clock the CPU can process one or more instructions. The more clock ticks there are, the faster instructions can be processed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>CPU Registers</h3>
        <p>Registers are very fast, small memory locations inside the CPU used as temporary stores for instructions and data being processed.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Program Counter (PC)</strong> – keeps track of where the CPU is in the program, points to the next instruction in the cycle.</li>
          <li><strong>Memory Address Register (MAR)</strong> – holds the address of the instruction or data to be fetched.</li>
          <li><strong>Memory Data Register (MDR)</strong> – stores the instruction or data that has been fetched from memory.</li>
          <li><strong>Accumulator (ACC)</strong> – stores the most recent result of processing.</li>
        </ul>

      </div>

      <div class="knowledge-card">
        <h3>Buses</h3>
        <p>Buses are the communication pathways that carry data, addresses and control signals around the computer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Address bus</strong> – carries memory addresses, <em>uni-directional</em> (from CPU to memory).</li>
          <li><strong>Data bus</strong> – carries instructions and data, <em>bi-directional</em> (to and from the CPU).</li>
          <li><strong>Control bus</strong> – carries commands from the CPU and status messages from devices, <em>bi-directional</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fetch–Decode–Execute (FDE) Cycle</h3>

        <p>
          The <strong>fetch–decode–execute cycle</strong> is the process the CPU uses to run programs:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> The address of the next instruction is held in the PC. This address is copied to the MAR. The address bus carries it to main memory. The control bus sends a read signal, and the instruction is transferred along the data bus into the MDR.</li>
          <li><strong>Decode:</strong> The CU decodes the instruction in the MDR, working out which circuits are needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Execute:</strong> The instruction is carried out (e.g. ALU performs a calculation, a value is loaded/stored, a jump occurs). The PC is updated to point to the next instruction.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
        <p>An <strong>embedded system</strong> is a computer system that is part of a larger device and performs a dedicated function.</p>

          <ul>
          <li>Usually has a small processor, limited memory and simple input/output.</li>
          <li>Examples: washing machines, microwave ovens, robotic vacuum cleaners, car engine management systems.</li>
          <li>Often uses <strong>firmware</strong> – software stored in ROM.</li>

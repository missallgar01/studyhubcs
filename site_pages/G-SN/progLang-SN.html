  <h3>High-Level Programming Languages</h3>
  <p>
    High-level programming languages are closer to human language and are therefore
    easier for humans to understand. A translator is used to convert the instructions
    into code that the computer can understand.
  </p>
  <h3>High-Level Language Features</h3>
  <p>
    High-level languages allow programs to be written independently of the type
    of computer system. It is the compiler’s job to translate the code into the
    correct machine code for a particular computer.
  </p>

  <h3>Low-Level Programming Languages</h3>
  <p>
    Low-level programming languages include machine code and assembly language.
    They are difficult for humans to understand but allow direct control of the
    hardware.
  </p>

  <h4>Machine Code</h4>
  <p>
    Machine code is written in binary (0s and 1s) and can be processed directly
    by the CPU without needing to be translated. Machine code is specific to
    a particular processor.
  </p>

  <h4>Assembly Language</h4>
  <p>
    Assembly language uses mnemonics to represent instructions. It requires an
    assembler to translate the code into binary machine code.
  </p>

  <h3>Uses of Low-Level Languages</h3>
  <p>
    Low-level languages are appropriate for developing operating systems,
    embedded systems, and hardware device drivers.
  </p>

  <h4>Advantages of Low-Level Languages</h4>
  <p>
    Low-level languages are processor-specific and can manipulate hardware
    directly. They can be highly optimised, execute quickly, and use minimal
    memory. Each line of code represents one instruction.
  </p>

  <h4>Mnemonics</h4>
  <p>
    Mnemonics are short words used in assembly language to represent instructions,
    such as LOAD, ADD, STORE, and MOV.
  </p>

  <h4>Machine Code Instructions</h4>
  <p>
    Machine code instructions are made up of two parts: an operator, which is the
    instruction, and an operand, which is the value or memory address.
  </p>

  <h3>Program Translators</h3>
  <p>
    Program translators convert programs written in high-level or assembly
    languages into machine code so that they can be run on a computer.
  </p>

  <h4>Interpreter</h4>
  <p>
    An interpreter translates high-level code into machine code one instruction
    at a time while the program is running. It stops when an error is found, which
    makes debugging easier, but programs run more slowly.
  </p>

  <h4>Compiler</h4>
  <p>
    A compiler translates all the source code into machine code before the program
    is run. The machine code is saved as an executable file, allowing programs to
    run faster and be distributed without the source code.
  </p>

  <h4>Assembler</h4>
  <p>
    An assembler translates assembly language instructions into machine code so
    that they can be executed by the CPU.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>High-Level vs Low-Level Languages</h3>
  <p>
    High-level languages use English-like instructions and are machine-independent,
    while low-level languages use mnemonics or binary, are machine-specific, and
    allow direct control of hardware.
  </p>

  <h4>Compiler vs Interpreter</h4>
  <p>
    A compiler translates all code at once and produces a standalone executable,
    while an interpreter translates code line by line each time the program runs
    and reports errors as they occur.

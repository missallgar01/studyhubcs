      <h3>Computational Thinking</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Computational thinking</strong> is the ability to think about how a computer could be used to solve a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Algorithms</strong> are a step-by-step set of instructions used to solve a problem.
        Algorithms can be written as <strong>pseudocode</strong> or <strong>flowcharts</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Pseudocode</strong> is written in English and is used to plan an algorithm before programming.
        It allows programmers using different programming languages to understand the logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Flowcharts</strong> are visual diagrams used to design algorithms that can be implemented in any programming language.
        Common flowchart symbols include:
      </p>

    <img src="images/CT/flowchart.png" height="172" width="420"/>
    </figure>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start/Stop</strong> – beginning or end of an algorithm</li>
        <li><strong>Decision</strong> – a yes/no or true/false choice</li>
        <li><strong>Input/Output</strong> – data entering or leaving the system</li>
        <li><strong>Process</strong> – an instruction or calculation</li>
        <li><strong>Function / Subroutine</strong> – a reusable block of code</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Decomposition</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Decomposition</strong> is the process of <strong>breaking down a large problem into a set of smaller problems</strong>.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Benefits of decomposition:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Smaller problems are easier to solve</li>
    <li>Each smaller problem can be solved independently</li>
    <li>Smaller problems can be tested independently</li>
    <li>The smaller problems can be combined to solve the full problem</li>
      <li>
      It allows a task to be tackled by a <strong>team working together</strong>,
      with each person contributing their own insights, experience, and skills
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

        <div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Example</h3>

  <p><strong>Example: Logging on to a system</strong></p>

  <p>When a user logs on, the program can be decomposed into the following steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ask the user for their username</li>
    <li>Ask the user for their password</li>
    <li>Check if the username exists and is valid</li>
    <li>If not valid, ask for the username again</li>
    <li>Check if the password is correct</li>
    <li>If not correct, ask for the password again</li>
    <li>Check if the user has used all 3 attempts</li>
    <li>Lock the account if the maximum attempts are reached</li>
  </ul>
<figure><img src="images/CT/login.png" height="165" width="303"/></figure>
  <p>
    Each of these steps can be programmed, tested, and improved separately before
    being combined into the full login system.
  </p>

  <h3>Abstraction</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Abstraction</strong> is the process of <strong>removing unnecessary details</strong> of a problem to
    <strong>focus on the important features</strong> needed to implement a solution.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Examples of abstraction include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Modelling a real-life object</li>
    <li>Modelling an environment</li>
    <li>Modelling an action or sequence of actions</li>
    <li>Modelling a concept</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Implementations of abstraction include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>A computer game that simulates playing a sport</li>
    <li>A simulator such as a car or flight simulator</li>
  <li>a map of a bus or train route in a city</li>
  </ul>

    <p>When creating a program, developers must
identify important features
that willcontribute to solving the problem or have a role to play in the solution</p>

<h3>Abstraction – Why is it used?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Helps identify what the <strong>important details</strong> are when designing an algorithm
      (data and processes)
    </li>
    <li>
      Removes detail that <strong>is not needed</strong>, making the problem easier to solve
    </li>
    <li>
      Helps to <strong>reduce complexity</strong>, making the implementation
      <strong>simpler, more efficient, and quicker</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>


      <div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Abstraction – SatNav Map Example</h3>
<figure><img src="images/CT/satnav.jpg" height="215" width="333"/></figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Abstraction</strong> involves <strong>removing unnecessary details</strong> so the user can
    focus on the <strong>most important information</strong>.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Example: Designing a SatNav map</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Important information to include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>A clear view of the roads</li>
    <li>Main roads and minor roads shown differently</li>
    <li>Petrol stations and places to eat shown using symbols</li>
    <li>Directions, distance, and speed limits</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Less important information to remove:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scenery such as trees and fields</li>
    <li>Individual houses</li>
    <li>Other cars on the road</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By removing unnecessary detail, the SatNav becomes easier to read and helps the
    driver focus on navigation.
  </p>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Subprograms</h3>

  <p>
    A <strong>subprogram</strong> is an <strong>out-of-line block of code</strong> that can be
    run by simply calling its <strong>name</strong> from elsewhere in a program.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each subprogram has a <strong>unique name</strong> so it can be called whenever it is needed.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Benefits of using subprograms:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps break large problems into smaller parts (<strong>decomposition</strong>)</li>
    <li>Allows team members to work on <strong>different parts</strong> of a program</li>
    <li>Makes programs <strong>easier to debug</strong></li>
    <li>Makes programs <strong>more efficient</strong> by avoiding duplicated code</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Types of subprogram:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Procedure</strong> – a subprogram that does <strong>not return</strong> a value
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Function</strong> – a subprogram that <strong>returns one or more values</strong>
      to the calling code
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h4>Examples (Python)</h4>

  <pre><code>
# Subprogram 1 – Procedure
def information():
    first_name = input("Enter a name: ")
    surname = input("Enter a surname: ")

# Subprogram 2 – Function
def tax(pay_per_hour, hours_worked):
    total = pay_per_hour * hours_worked
    net_pay = total * 0.8
    return net_pay

# Main program
information()           # call procedure
print(tax(10, 20))      # call function
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Procedures perform tasks, while functions perform tasks
    <strong>and return a result</strong>.

  <h3>Benefits of Networking</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Share files and data between computers</li>
    <li>Share applications and software</li>
    <li>Collaborate with other users</li>
    <li>Share peripherals such as printers</li>
    <li>Share internet connectivity</li>
    <li>Central control of security</li>
    <li>Central management of software updates</li>
    <li>Centralised backups</li>

<div class="knowledge-card">
    <h3>LAN vs WAN</h3>
  <h4>LAN (Local Area Network)</h4>
  <p>
    A LAN covers a small geographical area, such as a single building or campus.
    It usually uses infrastructure owned by one organisation and connects devices
    using switches.
  </p>

  <h4>WAN (Wide Area Network)</h4>
  <p>
    A WAN covers a large geographical area and connects multiple LANs. It often
    uses third-party infrastructure and connects networks using gateways.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
    <h3>Wired vs Wireless</h3>
  <h4>Wired Networks</h4>
  <p>
    Wired networks use cables to transmit data. They offer higher speeds, greater
    reliability, and improved security, but cables can be difficult to maintain
    in large organisations.
  </p>

  <h4>Wireless Networks</h4>
  <p>
    Wireless networks use radio waves on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.
    They allow mobility but can suffer from interference, security issues, and
    slower speeds compared to wired networks.
  </p>


  <h4>Factors Affecting Wireless Network Performance</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Walls and floors can block or weaken wireless signals.</li>
    <li>Interference from other wireless networks or electronic devices.</li>
    <li>Limited bandwidth available to wireless devices.</li>
    <li>The number of devices connected to the network sharing the bandwidth.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Network Hardware</h3>
  <p>
    Network hardware includes wireless access points that convert signals into
    radio waves, switches that connect devices on a LAN, routers that connect
    networks, and network interface cards (NICs) that allow devices to connect
    to a network.

  <h3>IP and MAC Addresses</h3>
  <p>
    Every device has a MAC address that never changes and is used for communication
    on a LAN. Devices also have IP addresses, which can change and are used to
    route data across networks such as the internet.
  </p>

  <h4>IP Address and MAC Address (with Examples)</h4>

  <h3>Network Topology</h3>
  <p>
    A network topology describes how devices are arranged within a network, such
    as star, bus, or mesh topologies.

  <h3>The Internet</h3>
  <p>
    The internet is made up of backbones, network access points, and routers that
    forward data between networks. Each device connected to the internet is given
    an IP address.
  </p>

  <h4>DNS (Domain Name System)</h4>
  <p>
    DNS converts human-readable domain names and website addresses into IP
    addresses so data can be routed correctly.
  </p>

   <h4>How a Website is Requested</h4>

<ol>
  <li>You type a website address (URL) into the browser.</li>
  <li>DNS finds the IP address of the website.</li>
  <li>Your browser sends an HTTP (or HTTPS) request to the web server.</li>
  <li>The web server sends the webpage data back using HTTP (or HTTPS).</li>
  <li>Your browser displays the webpage.</li>
</ol>

  <h3>Packet Switching</h3>

  <p>
    Packet switching is a method used to send data across the internet.
    Large pieces of data are split into smaller units called <strong>packets</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each packet can take a <strong>different route</strong> across the network
    and may arrive at the destination <strong>out of order</strong>.
  </p>
<div class="truthtable">
    <div class="links"><a class="btn" data-file="../G-tools/packet-switching.html">Packet Switching Demo</a></div>
</div>

  <h4>What information is stored in each packet?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Source address</li>
    <li>Destination address</li>
    <li>Sequence number</li>
    <li>Error-checking data (checksum)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Why data is split into packets</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Speeds up data transfer</li>
    <li>Reduces reliance on one single route</li>
    <li>Limits the impact of data corruption</li>
    <li>Allows packets to be resent if lost</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>What happens at the destination?</h4>
  <p>
    The sequence numbers are used to place packets back into the correct order.
    If any packets are missing or corrupted, they are requested again.

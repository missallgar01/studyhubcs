  <h3>3. Question</h3>

  <p>
    The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (2000) has been described as both a vital legal tool to ensure the public’s safety and an attack on an individual’s freedoms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Evaluate the purpose and use of the Act.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should include:
    <br>• the additional powers given under the Act
    <br>• to whom these powers are given
    <br>• the perceived benefits and/or drawbacks of the Act.

  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) gives authorities additional powers to monitor and intercept electronic communications such as emails, phone calls and internet activity. It also allows organisations to demand access to communications data and, in some cases, require individuals or companies to hand over encryption keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      These powers are given to organisations such as the police, security services, local councils and other public bodies. The purpose of the Act is to help prevent and investigate serious crimes such as terrorism and organised crime, improving public safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      A benefit of RIPA is that it allows law enforcement agencies to detect and disrupt criminal activity before harm occurs. However, a major drawback is that it can be seen as an invasion of privacy, as innocent individuals may have their communications monitored. Some believe the wide range of organisations with access to these powers makes misuse more likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, while RIPA helps protect national security, it raises ethical concerns about civil liberties and personal privacy.

  <h3>4. Question</h3>

  <p>
    The Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 applies to all videos that are streamed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Explain how this act applies to the videos.
  </p>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      The Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 gives automatic copyright protection to the creator of the video. This means others cannot legally copy, distribute or use the video without permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Streaming services must have permission or licences to show the videos, and copyright holders can request removal if their content is used without authorisation.

  <h3>5. Question</h3>

  <p>
    Many technologists predict that in the future, shops on the high street will use facial recognition to identify customers before they walk into a shop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Discuss the possible benefits and drawbacks of technology being used in this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should refer to:
    <br>• the benefits and drawbacks to both customers and businesses
    <br>• moral and ethical issues
    <br>• legal issues
  </p>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      Facial recognition could benefit customers by allowing personalised offers and faster service. Businesses could benefit from targeted advertising and better understanding of customer behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, customers may see this as an invasion of privacy and feel uncomfortable being tracked. There are moral and ethical concerns about loss of civil liberties and consent, especially if people are recorded without entering the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legally, businesses would need to comply with data protection laws by keeping data secure, accurate and only using it for specific purposes. Data breaches could damage trust and reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the technology could increase profits, the ethical and legal risks may outweigh the benefits if not carefully controlled.

  <h3>6. Question</h3>

  <p>
    “The Computer Misuse Act means that computer users are criminalised for simply trying to learn how systems work.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Discuss whether or not you agree with this statement.
  </p>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      The Computer Misuse Act makes unauthorised access to computer systems illegal, even if no harm is intended. This can make it seem like learning how systems work is criminalised.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the Act protects systems and users from hacking and misuse. Users are allowed to investigate systems if they have permission, such as ethical hackers or system owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the law does not prevent learning, but it requires authorisation to ensure systems are protected from harm.

  <h3>7. Question</h3>

  <p>
    “When it comes to government electronic surveillance, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Discuss whether or not you agree with this statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should include:
    <br>• to what extent the UK government is able to monitor electronic communications
    <br>• technical measures citizens can take to help prevent their communications being monitored.
  </p>

  <textarea class="student-answer" placeholder="Write your answer here..."></textarea>

  <button class="secondary answer-toggle">Show answer</button>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>
      The UK government can monitor electronic communications under laws such as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. This allows authorities to intercept messages if there is legal justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizens can use encryption, secure messaging apps and VPNs to reduce monitoring. However, authorities may still require access to encrypted data in some cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      While surveillance can improve security, it risks invading privacy. Even innocent people may wish to protect personal communications, so having “nothing to hide” does not remove concerns about freedom and civil liberties.

    <p><strong>Indicative points (mark scheme):</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> additional rights/powers regarding surveillance/monitoring and acquisition of communications data.</li>
      <li>Gives many organisations (including Police and security services) the right to do this.</li>
      <li>Purpose: detect crime and defend national security (e.g. terrorism, public disorder).</li>
      <li>Can give access to private communications (emails, texts, phone calls, internet history).</li>
      <li>Privacy concerns / invasion of privacy for individuals.</li>
      <li><strong>Application:</strong> powers used by more organisations than just Police/security services (e.g. local councils, pension regulator, Environment Agency).</li>
      <li>If files are encrypted, powers to force handover of keys (possible prison sentence for refusal).</li>
      <li>Wide powers can help intercept criminals’ communications and stop/disrupt crime.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> may be important in modern world to tackle electronic communications; can stop crimes before they occur (public safety).</li>
      <li>Criticism: “snooper’s charter”; powers may be used for minor offences (e.g. address fraud for school places, fly-tipping).</li>
      <li>End-to-end encryption tools limit what organisations can divulge; other tools (e.g. plausible deniability) exist.</li>

      <li><strong>AO1:</strong> AI = computer systems performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.</li>

      <li><strong>AO2:</strong> if program contains biases, AI outcomes can be biased; designers/testers must tackle this.</li>
      <li>ML bias depends on training data; larger datasets can be more representative, but datasets themselves may be biased.</li>
      <li><strong>AO3:</strong> thorough testing, multiple programmers, and scrutiny of datasets to reduce unconscious bias.</li>

      <li>RIPA can compel disclosure of encryption keys.</li>

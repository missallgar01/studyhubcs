        <ul>
          <li>The spiral model has four quadrants: determine objectives, identify and manage risk, develop and test, plan next iteration.</li>
          <li>Client feedback informs future development and prototypes.</li>
          <li>Waterfall has structured analysis, design, development and testing stages.</li>
          <li>Progress to the next stage is not made until the previous stage is completed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>AO2 – Application</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spiral relies on frequent client feedback and produces functional prototypes.</li>
          <li>Spiral focuses on risk; projects may be modified or dropped if risk is too great.</li>
          <li>Waterfall relies on clear requirements defined early; changes are difficult later.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>AO3 – Evaluation</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spiral is better where requirements may change and risk management is important.</li>
          <li>Waterfall is better where requirements are clear and outcomes are known.</li>

        <p><strong>Model top-band answer:</strong></p>

        <p>
          A large-scale software project is complex, expensive, and often involves
          many stakeholders, so the choice of development methodology is important.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>Waterfall lifecycle</strong> uses a structured sequence of
          stages such as analysis, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation.
          This can be beneficial for large projects because it produces clear
          documentation and allows progress to be managed easily. However, it is
          inflexible, as changes require revisiting earlier stages, which can be
          costly and time-consuming.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Agile methodologies</strong> use iterative development with
          frequent user feedback. This allows requirements to change throughout the
          project, which can be useful if user needs are unclear. However, for a
          large-scale project, Agile can be difficult to manage due to reduced
          documentation and the need for constant user involvement.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>Spiral model</strong> combines iterative development with
          detailed risk analysis. This makes it particularly suitable for
          large-scale, high-risk projects, as risks are identified and mitigated
          early. The main drawback is that it is expensive due to the need for
          specialist risk assessors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, the spiral model is often the most suitable methodology for a
          large-scale software project because it balances structure with flexibility
          and focuses heavily on managing risk.

            <ul>
              <li>Memory contents are divided into fixed-size pages.</li>
              <li>Pages that are not currently needed are moved to an area of secondary storage used as virtual memory.</li>

            <p><strong>(b)</strong> An area of backing store (e.g. hard disk) is used as if it were main memory. The OS uses paging to swap pages between RAM and this storage so that pages currently needed are in RAM and others are held on disk.</p>
            <p><strong>(c)</strong> Disk thrashing occurs when so many page swaps are taking place that the computer spends more time transferring pages between RAM and disk than doing real processing. Because the disk is relatively slow, performance collapses and the system may appear to hang.</p>

              <li>Uses <strong>paging</strong> (fixed-size physical divisions) and/or <strong>segmentation</strong> (variable-size logical divisions) to split memory.</li>

              <li>Uses <strong>virtual memory</strong> when RAM is nearly full – moves pages to backing store and swaps them back when needed.</li>
              <li>Prevents one process accessing memory reserved for another (security and stability).</li>
              <li>Frees memory when programs finish or no longer need it (garbage collection / deallocation).</li>

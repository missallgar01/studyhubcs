  <h3>Ethical Issues</h3>
  <p>
    An ethical issue is a situation that raises questions about what is right
    and wrong.
  </p>

  <h3>Social and Cultural Issues</h3>
  <p>
    Social and cultural issues include the digital divide, privacy concerns
    related to surveillance, and the impact of social media.

  <h3>Personal Data</h3>
  <p>
    Personal data is information that can be used to identify an individual.
    Examples include data collected using GPS, facial recognition, number plate
    recognition, smart devices, surveys, and official government or medical
    services.
  </p>

  <h3>Privacy Issues in Computing</h3>
  <p>
    Privacy issues include facial recognition, GPS tracking, and internet
    monitoring. These raise concerns about who is collecting data, how it is
    used, and who has access to it.
  </p>

  <h3>Internet Monitoring</h3>
  <p>
    Schools, businesses, and social media companies use monitoring software to
    track activity. This can help prevent harmful behaviour but raises concerns
    about free speech, misuse, and biased systems.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>AI and Robotics Ethical Issues</h3>
  <p>
    Ethical concerns with AI and robotics include accountability, bias,
    safety, job displacement, and privacy.
  </p>

  <h4>Algorithmic Bias</h4>
  <p>
    Algorithmic bias can be caused by poor training data, human bias, or poor
    algorithm design. This can lead to discrimination and unfair outcomes.
  </p>

  <h4>Reducing Algorithmic Bias</h4>
  <p>
    Methods to reduce bias include human oversight, governance, and improving
    the quality of training data.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Environmental Impact of Computing</h3>
  <p>
    Computing impacts the environment through energy use, extraction of raw
    materials, data centres, electronic waste, and frequent replacement cycles.
  </p>

  <h4>Reducing Environmental Impact</h4>
  <p>
    Environmental impact can be reduced by keeping devices longer, repairing
    them, reusing or donating devices, and keeping software updated.
  </p>
</div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity is concerned with the protection of computer systems,
    computer networks, and data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its purpose is to protect computers and networks from cyberattacks,
    prevent unauthorised access, protect against damage caused by
    malicious software, prevent data theft, and protect against the
    disruption of services.
  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Cyber Security Threats</h3>
  <p>
    Cyber security threats are actions or weaknesses that can damage,
    disrupt, or take control of computer systems or data.

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Brute Force Attacks</h3>
  <p>
    Brute force attacks attempt to gain access by trying every possible
    combination of passwords.
  </p>


  <h3>Weak Passwords</h3>
  <p>
    Weak passwords are easy to guess. Dictionary attacks use algorithms
    to systematically try common words until the password is cracked.
  </p>


  <h3>Default Passwords</h3>
  <p>
    Default passwords are given to users when accounts are created.
    If not changed, they pose a major security risk, especially when
    sent unencrypted via email.
  </p>


  <h3>Removable Media</h3>
  <p>
    Removable media such as USB pen drives can transmit malware between
    computer systems.
  </p>


  <h3>Unpatched or Outdated Software</h3>
  <p>
    Software that is not regularly updated remains vulnerable to attack
    because security vulnerabilities have not been fixed.
  </p>


  <h3>Misconfigured Access Rights</h3>
  <p>
    Users should only have access to files and data they need. Incorrect
    access rights can give users access they should not have.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
  <p>
    Penetration testing is legitimate testing of an organisation’s
    computer systems to identify vulnerabilities so they can be fixed
    before an attacker exploits them.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Preventing Cybersecurity Threats</h3>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity threats can be reduced using biometric measures,
    automatic software updates, secure password systems, email
    verification, and anti-virus software.
  </p>

    <b>Model full-marks answer:</b>
    <p>
      Algorithmic bias occurs when systems are trained using biased data, causing them to make
      unfair decisions. This can disadvantage certain groups, for example by rejecting job
      applications or loan requests unfairly. Because algorithms can lack transparency, affected
      individuals may not understand or challenge decisions, reinforcing existing inequalities.

  <h3>Benefits of Networking</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Share files and data between computers</li>
    <li>Share applications and software</li>
    <li>Collaborate with other users</li>
    <li>Share peripherals such as printers</li>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>LAN (Local Area Network)</h3>
  <p>
    A LAN covers a small geographical area, such as a single building or campus.
    It usually uses infrastructure owned by one organisation and connects devices
    using switches.
  </p>

  <h3>WAN (Wide Area Network)</h3>
  <p>
    A WAN covers a large geographical area and connects multiple LANs. It often
    uses third-party infrastructure and connects networks using gateways.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Wired Networks</h3>
  <p>
    Wired networks use cables to transmit data. They offer higher speeds, greater
    reliability, and improved security, but cables can be difficult to maintain
    in large organisations.
  </p>

  <h3>Wireless Networks</h3>
  <p>
    Wireless networks use radio waves on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.
    They allow mobility but can suffer from interference, security issues, and
    slower speeds compared to wired networks.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Network Hardware</h3>
  <p>
    Network hardware includes wireless access points that convert signals into
    radio waves, switches that connect devices on a LAN, routers that connect
    networks, and network interface cards (NICs) that allow devices to connect
    to a network.

  <h3>IP and MAC Addresses</h3>
  <p>
    Every device has a MAC address that never changes and is used for communication
    on a LAN. Devices also have IP addresses, which can change and are used to
    route data across networks such as the internet.

  <h3>Factors Affecting Wireless Network Performance</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Walls and floors can block or weaken wireless signals.</li>
    <li>Interference from other wireless networks or electronic devices.</li>
    <li>Limited bandwidth available to wireless devices.</li>
    <li>The number of devices connected to the network sharing the bandwidth.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Network Speed</h3>
  <p>
    Network speed is affected by <strong>latency</strong>, which is the delay between sending and
    receiving data, and <strong>bandwidth</strong>, which is the maximum amount of data that can
    be transmitted per second.
  </p>

      Devices connect directly to each other with no central switch.
      Data can travel via multiple routes.

      Very reliable as multiple routes are available.<br>
      Data can take the fastest route.

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>The Internet</h3>
  <p>
    The internet is made up of backbones, network access points, and routers that
    forward data between networks. Each device connected to the internet is given
    an IP address.
  </p>

  <h3>DNS (Domain Name System)</h3>
  <p>
    DNS converts human-readable domain names and website addresses into IP
    addresses so data can be routed correctly.
  </p>
</div>

  <div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Packet Switching</h3>

  <p>
    Packet switching is a method used to send data across the internet.
    Large pieces of data are split into smaller units called <strong>packets</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each packet can take a <strong>different route</strong> across the network
    and may arrive at the destination <strong>out of order</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4>What information is stored in each packet?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Source address</li>
    <li>Destination address</li>
    <li>Sequence number</li>
    <li>Error-checking data (checksum)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Why data is split into packets</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Speeds up data transfer</li>
    <li>Reduces reliance on one single route</li>
    <li>Limits the impact of data corruption</li>
    <li>Allows packets to be resent if lost</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>What happens at the destination?</h4>
  <p>
    The sequence numbers are used to place packets back into the correct order.
    If any packets are missing or corrupted, they are requested again.

  <h3>TCP/IP Model</h3>

      Computers are connected to networks to share files and peripherals.
      A LAN covers a small geographical area whereas a WAN covers a large geographical area.
      17.08 megabits per second is equal to 17,080,000 bits per second.
      Latency is the delay between data being sent and received.

  <h3>Systems Software</h3>
  <p>
    Systems software is software designed to maintain and control the hardware.
    It also provides an interface between the hardware and software.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Operating System</h3>
  <p>
    An operating system controls the hardware and software and provides an
    interface for the user.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Utility Programs</h3>
  <p>
    Utility programs help to maintain the computer.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Application Software</h3>
  <p>
    Application software is a collection of one or more programs used to solve
    a specific task.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Types of Application Software</h3>
  <p>
    Examples of application software include word processing software,
    spreadsheet software, database software, education software, and
    entertainment software.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Compression Software</h3>
  <p>
    Compression software reduces the size of a file stored on secondary storage.
    Smaller files are easier to transmit across a network as they require fewer
    packets and take up less storage space.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Defragmentation Software</h3>
  <p>
    Defragmentation software takes fragmented files and rearranges the segments
    so that they run contiguously. This decreases read and write time and speeds
    up computer performance.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Other Utility Software</h3>
  <p>
    Other utility software includes automatic backup and system updates,
    anti-virus and firewall software, and disk repair tools used to fix corrupted
    files.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>User Interface</h3>
  <p>
    A user interface allows the user to communicate with the hardware.
    Types of user interface include command line interfaces, graphical user
    interfaces (GUI), and voice interfaces.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Memory Management</h3>
  <p>
    Memory management uses paging to allocate sections of RAM to processes.
    Data is moved between RAM and virtual memory to free space and allow
    higher-priority processes to run efficiently.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Peripheral Management and Drivers</h3>
  <p>
    A device driver is a program that controls a peripheral device and allows
    the operating system to communicate with it. A peripheral is an external
    device such as a monitor or keyboard.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>User Management</h3>
  <p>
    User management allows users to log on by checking usernames and passwords.
    Users can be added or deleted, permissions can be enforced, and the amount
    of storage each user can access can be controlled.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>File Management</h3>
  <p>
    File management stores data in a hierarchical structure and allows users
    to create, rename, copy, move, delete, search for, retrieve, and edit
    files and folders.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Process Scheduling</h3>
  <p>
    A multitasking operating system executes one process at a time but allows
    multiple applications to run by rapidly switching between processes using
    time slices. Processes are held in a queue and controlled by a scheduling
    algorithm.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Authentication</h3>
  <p>
    Authentication is a process used to test that a person is who they claim
    to be.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Code Reviews</h3>
  <p>
    Code reviews involve checking program code with another person to identify
    errors or security issues that may have been missed.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="knowledge-card">
  <h3>Audit Trails</h3>
  <p>
    An audit trail records changes made to software, including who made the
    change and when. This allows problems or security flaws to be traced and
    fixed.
  </p>
</div>
</div>

    <b>Model full-marks answer:</b>
    <p>
      The operating system uses a scheduler to allocate a short time slice of CPU time to each process.
      This ensures all processes get a chance to run.
      Another function of the operating system is file management.
